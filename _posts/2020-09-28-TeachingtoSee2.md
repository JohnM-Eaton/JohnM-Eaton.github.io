title: Ten Observations from "Teaching to See"
---

The following observations were taken from reacting to the film ["Teaching to See"](http://teachingtosee.org/film/TeachingToSee.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI38GMg8eH2QIVFLbACh0vIwqcEAAYASAAEgKzp_D_BwE)

•	“If you love something, the work will be just fine.” This quote highlights the importance passion can have in one’s work. For instance, I had always found it humorous when chefs would say “Love” is their secret ingredient. When the pandemic started, I began cooking and baking as a hobby. Now I can definitely tell the difference in flavor for dishes where the cook “put in the love.” This intangible ingredient can really make one’s work stand out. 
•	Take the time to “stare” at your visualization. What is there? What is not there? What does it truly need?
•	The “eye” is a conservative part of reading; it wants everything perfect and rational. The hand, conversely, wants to write fast and expressively. This “battle” can present itself in data visualization. An author may want to write their findings as the hand wants them to, but the time needs to be taken to write with the reader’s “eye” in mind.
•	There is a difference between “copying thoughtfully” and “mindlessly copying.” 
•	Geometric accuracy vs optical accuracy. The visual may be “geometrically accurate,” but how does it look to the observer? 
•	Use color intelligently- balancing between hue, grey value, and brightness (the full saturation of a color; i.e. the “bluest blue”). The human eye is very sensitive, and can usually see gradual variations of color.
•	Bad maps use a lot of bright colors and get “noisy.” These are examples of using color unintelligently. 
•	Graphic design is about visualizing an idea, drawing attention, and informing. But it’s also about symbolizing something. Like poetry, it’s about getting the “essence” of something.
•	One of the most important things students had to get right in designing their own typeface was coherency. Each of the letters had to share a common structure, yet be distinct enough to be read. This could be applied to visualizing data, in that it would help aid observers “read” the story being told by the chart/graphic.
•	Artful images make observers strive to see beyond what it is. What is the image “doing?”
